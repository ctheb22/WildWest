Channels:
Channels uses "Redis" as it's channel layer store. Redis is apparently a
  db-like service that runs on a server and integrates nicely with channels.
  The easiest/quickest way to get a redis server running is to use docker to
  spin up a self contained server locally.

python -m pip install channels_redis

docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis:5
#Start redis docker using port 6379 for game. This is needed for channels to
  communicate with each other.
